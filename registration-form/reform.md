User Feedback: Displays a success or error message after form submission based on the input validation.
Responsive Design: The form is styled to look modern and easy to use with an attractive submit button and hover effects.
Design Details:
Input Fields: Styled with padding and rounded corners for a clean, modern look.
Submit Button: Styled with a green color and hover effect to indicate interactivity.
Status Message: The status of the registration is displayed below the form to notify users of the success or failure of the registration.
CSS Highlights:
Responsive Layout: Ensures the form is centered and easy to interact with on all screen sizes.
Hover Effects: The submit button changes color on hover to give feedback to the user. -->
